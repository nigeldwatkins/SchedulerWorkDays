# SchedulerWorkDays

## Objective
I was given some starter code and the goal was to create a work day scheduler for my user. I needed to make sure that it displayed
<br> the time for my user and that itll be able to save their information once they submit it. Once they refresh the page the data
<br> collected will appear.

## Preview of Schedule
Below is a Work schedule for a 8 hour day, the schedule will change colors based on the time of the day, grey for past, red for 
<br> present and green for future. The schedule also have the time and day of the week it is which is displayed as
<br> Day , Month, date, year | and the time is hour, minute, seconds. and it is based of the time that it currently is now. 
<br> below is a preview of the finished work.
